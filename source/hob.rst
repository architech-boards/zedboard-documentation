Hob is a graphical interface for Bitbake. It can be called once Bitbake environment has been setup (see
:ref:`bitbake_label`) like this:

.. host::

 hob

once open, you are required to select the machine you want to compile against

.. image:: _static/hob-select-machine.png
    :align: center

after that, you can select the image you want to build and, of course, you can customize it.
