SDK
===

The SDK provided by *Architech* to support ZedBoard is composed by several components, the most important of which are:

* **Yocto**,

* **Eclipse**, and

* **Qt Creator**

Regarding the installation and configuration of these tools, you have many options:

1) get a virtual machine with everything already setup,

2) download a script to setup your Ubuntu machine, or

3) just get the meta-layer and compose your SDK by hand

The method you choose depends on your level of expertise and the results you want to achieve.

If you are new to **Yocto** and/or **Linux**, or simply you don't want to read tons of documentation right now,
we suggest you to download and :ref:`install the virtual machine <vm_label>` because it is the simplest solution
(have a look at :ref:`vm-layout_label`), everything inside the virtual machine has been thought to work out of the
box, plus you will get support.

If performances are your greatest concerns, consider reading Chapter :ref:`create_sdk_label`.
